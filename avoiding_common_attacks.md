My project has implemented the ciruit breaker design pattern so that in the case of a malicious attack, a Marketplace admin could stop its functionality.
I have also used a pull payment system by storing and updating a balance in my MaketPlace contract in the withdraw function.
Additionally, I have used several modifiers throughout both the Marketplace and StoreOwner contracts to ensure that only admins and StoreOwner owners can perform sensetive functions on MarketPlace and StoreOwner contracts respectively.
